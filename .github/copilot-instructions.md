# Capstone Project: Workout Tracker

## Project Overview
This is a **Workout Tracker** React application built with **Vite** and modern tooling. The app is in early development (currently boilerplate from Vite React template).

**Key Stack:**
- React 19.2.0 with Hooks (functional components)
- Vite 7.2.4 (fast build tool & dev server)
- ESLint 9.39.1 for code quality
- React Fast Refresh enabled via `@vitejs/plugin-react`

## Directory Structure
```
workout-tracker/
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx           # Root component (currently boilerplate counter)
│   ├── main.jsx          # Entry point with React.StrictMode
│   ├── App.css           # App styles
│   ├── index.css         # Global styles
│   └── assets/           # Static images (React/Vite logos)
├── package.json          # Dependencies & scripts
├── vite.config.js        # Vite configuration with React plugin
├── eslint.config.js      # ESLint rules
└── index.html            # HTML entry point
```

## Development Workflow

**Start dev server:**
```bash
cd workout-tracker
npm run dev              # Runs on http://localhost:5173 with HMR
```

**Build for production:**
```bash
npm run build            # Outputs to dist/
npm run preview          # Test production build locally
```

**Linting:**
```bash
npm run lint             # Check code quality
```

## Code Patterns & Conventions

### React Components
- **Functional components with Hooks only** — no class components
- State: Use `useState()` for local state
- Side effects: Use `useEffect()` (lazy-loaded when needed)
- All components in `src/` directory as `.jsx` files

### Styling Approach
- **CSS Modules or inline styles** — no CSS-in-JS library yet
- Global styles in `src/index.css`
- Component-specific styles in corresponding `.css` files (e.g., `App.jsx` → `App.css`)

### File Organization
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- For features requiring multiple related components, create a subdirectory:
  ```
  src/features/workout/
  ├── WorkoutList.jsx
  ├── WorkoutForm.jsx
  └── workout.css
  ```

## Build & Deployment Notes
- **Output:** `dist/` folder (generated by `npm run build`)
- **Environment:** Define `.env` variables if needed (access via `import.meta.env.VITE_*`)
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Enabled by default in dev mode

## Critical Project Patterns

### State Management Strategy
- **No Redux/Context API yet** — Use local component state with `useState()` only
- When cross-component state becomes necessary, create a custom Hook or consider Context API
- Example: Workout list state stays in parent component, filter state in child

### Data Flow Architecture
- Components are stateless consumers of props
- Parent components (`App.jsx`, feature parent containers) manage state
- Props are passed down; callbacks passed up for state changes
- **No prop drilling beyond 2-3 levels** — refactor to feature subdirectories if needed

### Common Development Commands
```bash
cd workout-tracker

# Quick checks before committing
npm run lint              # Identify style/quality issues
npm run build             # Verify production build succeeds

# Iterative development
npm run dev              # Watch mode with HMR (keeps running)
npm run preview          # Test dist/ locally after build
```

## AI Agent Priorities

When implementing features, prioritize in this order:
1. **Functional components first** — Convert to Hooks, no lifecycle methods
2. **Props-based component communication** — Keep data flow simple
3. **Minimal CSS** — Use utility classes or scoped `.css` files, not inline styles
4. **ESLint compliance** — Run `npm run lint` after feature completion
5. **HMR-friendly** — Avoid export defaults that break Fast Refresh (use named exports when unsure)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Class components or `this.setState()`
- ❌ Global state libraries without discussion
- ❌ Inline styles for layout (use CSS files instead)
- ❌ Hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- ❌ Direct DOM manipulation (React handles it)
- ❌ Multiple state sources of truth (single source per feature)

COMMON ISSUES ENCOUNTERED DURING INTEGRATION

Issue 1: Project Creation Directory Confusion
Problem: Vite sometimes creates project files in the current directory instead of a new subdirectory
Solution: Always run `pwd && ls -la` after project creation to verify the actual structure

Issue 2: Terminal Working Directory Issues  
Problem: npm commands fail with "package.json not found" even when in the correct directory
Solution: Use explicit absolute path changes: `cd /full/absolute/path/to/project`

Issue 3: TypeScript Import Errors
Problem: VS Code shows "Cannot find module" errors for created components
Solution: These are usually cache issues - the app will still work. Create all components before testing.

Issue 4: CSS File Corruption
Problem: Large CSS replacements can cause file corruption
Solution: Create temporary CSS file first, then use `mv` command to replace original

Issue 5: Terminal Working Directory Not in Project Root
Problem: AI agent fails to run `npm run dev` because terminal is not in the auth0-react-app directory, even when pwd shows the correct path
Solution: Always use explicit directory change with absolute path before running npm commands:

  cd auth0-react-app && npm run dev

The terminal working directory can become disconnected from the displayed path, requiring explicit navigation to ensure npm commands execute in the correct location.
